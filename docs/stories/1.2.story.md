# Story 1.2: Email/Password Sign-up

## Status
TODO

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to be able to sign up for an account using my email and a password,
**so that** I can create my personal Track Journal account.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A sign-up screen is created
2. Input validation is present
3. "Sign Up" creates a user in Firebase Auth
4. A user document is created in Firestore
5. The user is navigated to the dashboard on success
6. Clear error messages are shown on failure

## Dev Notes
- Follow the authentication workflow from core-workflows.md
- Use the User data model from data-models.md
- Implement proper TypeScript types throughout
- Ensure all Firebase operations go through service layer
- Consider accessibility requirements (WCAG AA)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test auth service methods with mocked Firebase
- Unit test form validation logic
- Integration test the complete sign-up flow
- Test error scenarios (duplicate email, weak password, network errors)
- Verify Firestore user document creation
