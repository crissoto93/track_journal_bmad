# Story 2.5.2: Session Logging Form UX

## Status
ðŸ”„ **PENDING** - Ready for development

## Story
**As a** driver,
**I want** a well-designed session logging form,
**so that** I can efficiently record all my track data without missing fields.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Logical field grouping and flow that matches the user's mental model
2. Clear labels, placeholders, and helper text for complex fields
3. Appropriate input types for each field (text, number, date, select, etc.)
4. Progress indication for long forms with save-as-you-go functionality
5. Offline capability with clear sync status indicators

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Design Session Form Structure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Analyze user workflow and create logical field groupings
  - [ ] Design form sections (session info, vehicle setup, track conditions, performance data)
  - [ ] Create intuitive flow that matches driver's mental model
  - [ ] Implement collapsible sections for better organization
  - [ ] Add clear navigation between form sections

- [ ] Task 2: Implement Field Types and Validation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create appropriate input types for each data field
  - [ ] Implement number inputs for numeric data (lap times, temperatures, etc.)
  - [ ] Add date/time pickers for session dates and times
  - [ ] Create select dropdowns for categorical data (weather, track conditions)
  - [ ] Add text areas for notes and comments

- [ ] Task 3: Add Clear Labels and Help Text (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Write clear, concise labels for all form fields
  - [ ] Add helpful placeholder text with examples
  - [ ] Create tooltips or help text for complex fields
  - [ ] Implement field descriptions for technical terms
  - [ ] Add unit indicators where appropriate (mph, Â°C, psi, etc.)

- [ ] Task 4: Implement Progress and Save Features (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create progress indicator showing form completion
  - [ ] Implement auto-save functionality for form data
  - [ ] Add manual save button with clear feedback
  - [ ] Create form recovery for interrupted sessions
  - [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for important actions

- [ ] Task 5: Offline Functionality and Sync (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement offline form data storage
  - [ ] Create sync status indicators (online/offline, syncing, error)
  - [ ] Add background sync when connection is restored
  - [ ] Implement conflict resolution for offline changes
  - [ ] Add clear messaging about offline capabilities

- [ ] Task 6: Form UX Polish and Testing
  - [ ] Optimize form for mobile input (keyboard types, auto-focus)
  - [ ] Add form field dependencies and conditional logic
  - [ ] Implement form validation with helpful error messages
  - [ ] Test form accessibility and screen reader compatibility
  - [ ] Create form analytics to identify pain points

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Session logging form functionality already implemented in Story 2.4 [From: `docs/stories/2.4.story.md`]
- Offline functionality requirement (NFR1) already established
- Form should include all fields from FR5 specification

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript (~5.9), React Native (~0.81), React Native Paper (~5.14.x) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must work offline (NFR1) for form functionality
- Must integrate with existing session data models

### File Locations
- Session form components in dedicated form components or screen
- Form validation and offline storage utilities in `src/utils/` or `src/services/`
- Design system tokens from `src/theme/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing session CRUD operations
- Work with established design system from Story 1.5.1
- Use searchable dropdown component (FR8) for track selection
- Ensure compatibility with offline functionality and sync

### Data Models
- Session document structure already defined in architecture
- Form should map to session data model fields from FR5
- Validation should match backend data requirements

### User Experience Considerations
- Form should be optimized for track-side use (quick input, minimal typing)
- Consider voice input or camera integration for certain fields
- Implement smart defaults based on previous sessions
- Add quick templates for common session types
