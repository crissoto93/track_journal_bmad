## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Vehicle form functionality already implemented in Story 2.1 and 2.2 [From: `docs/stories/2.1.story.md`, `docs/stories/2.2.story.md`]
- Searchable dropdown component (FR8) already referenced in requirements
- Design system should be established from Story 1.5.1

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript (~5.9), React Native (~0.81), React Native Paper (~5.14.x) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must work offline (NFR1) for form functionality
- Must integrate with existing vehicle data models

### File Locations
- Vehicle form components in `src/screens/GarageScreen.tsx` or dedicated form components
- Form validation utilities in `src/utils/` or `src/components/`
- Design system tokens from `src/theme/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing vehicle CRUD operations
- Work with established design system from Story 1.5.1
- Use searchable dropdown component (FR8) for make/model selection
- Ensure compatibility with offline functionality

### Data Models
- Vehicle document structure already defined in architecture
- Form should map to vehicle data model fields
- Validation should match backend data requirements
