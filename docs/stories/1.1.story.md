# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Firebase Setup

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new React Native project initialized with all core dependencies and connected to a Firebase project,
**so that** I have a stable foundation to start building features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new React Native project is created
2. Firebase SDK is installed and configured for iOS/Android
3. The app connects to the Firebase project on startup
4. A basic placeholder screen is visible

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize React Native Project (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create new React Native project using React Native CLI
  - [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Verify project runs on iOS and Android simulators
- [x] Task 2: Install and Configure Core Dependencies (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Install Firebase SDK v11.x for React Native (installed 11.10.x)
  - [x] Install React Native Paper v5.14.x for UI components (latest available)
  - [x] Configure Firebase for iOS and Android platforms (JS Web SDK via `initializeApp` using env values; no native config required)
  - [x] Set up environment configuration (.env files) with `.env.example` and `@env` Babel plugin
- [x] Task 3: Implement Firebase Connection (AC: 3)
  - [x] Initialize Firebase on startup via `getFirebase()` service invoked by initial screen
  - [x] Create Firebase configuration service (`src/services/firebase.ts`)
  - [x] Add connection verification on app startup (status display on `PlaceholderScreen`)
  - [x] Implement error handling for Firebase connection failures (status fallback + console warning in dev)
- [x] Task 4: Create Basic UI Structure (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up basic navigation structure (React Navigation native stack)
  - [x] Create placeholder welcome/dashboard screen (`PlaceholderScreen`)
  - [x] Implement basic app layout with React Native Paper theme (light/dark)
  - [x] Add loading states and connection status indicators
- [x] Task 5: Set up Testing Infrastructure (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Configure Jest testing framework (RN preset, transforms, mocks)
  - [x] Set up Firebase Local Emulator Suite for testing (firebase.json, .firebaserc, scripts)
  - [x] Create basic test structure and examples
  - [x] Write unit tests and emulator-gated integration test for Firebase initialization
