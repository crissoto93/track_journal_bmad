- **Description**: Interactive HTML report with detailed test results, execution times, and failure details
- **Features**: 
  - Expandable test suites
  - Search functionality
  - Test execution timeline
  - Failure details with stack traces

### 2. JUnit XML Report
- **Location**: `test-reports/junit/junit.xml`
- **Description**: Standard JUnit XML format for CI/CD integration
- **Features**:
  - Compatible with Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
  - Structured test results
  - Failure categorization

### 3. Code Coverage Report
- **Location**: `test-reports/coverage/`
- **Description**: Detailed code coverage analysis
- **Features**:
  - Line-by-line coverage
  - Branch coverage
  - Function coverage
  - Statement coverage
  - HTML and JSON formats

### 4. QA Custom Report
- **Location**: `test-reports/qa-report.json`

  - Recommendations for improvement

## Usage

### Running Tests with Reports

```bash
# Run tests with all reports
npm run test:report

# Run tests with emulators and reports
npm run test:emu:report

# Run tests with coverage only
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Viewing Reports

```bash
# View QA report in terminal
npm run report:view

# View specific report types
npm run report:view:qa
npm run report:view:coverage

# Open reports in browser
npm run report:open:html
npm run report:open:coverage

# Clean all reports
npm run report:clean
```

### Using the Report Viewer

The custom report viewer provides a command-line interface for viewing test results:

```bash
# View QA report (default)
node scripts/test-report-viewer.js

# View QA report explicitly
node scripts/test-report-viewer.js qa

# View coverage report
node scripts/test-report-viewer.js coverage

# Open HTML report in browser
node scripts/test-report-viewer.js open html

# Open coverage report in browser
node scripts/test-report-viewer.js open coverage
```

## Report Metrics

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component/function tests
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction tests
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end user workflow tests

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Test Time**: Mean execution time across all tests
- **Slowest Tests**: Top 10 slowest test cases
- **Fastest Tests**: Top 10 fastest test cases

### Quality Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of passed tests
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Minimum coverage requirements (70% for all metrics)
- **Test Stability**: Identification of flaky tests

## Configuration

### Jest Configuration

The reporting is configured in `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
// Test reporting configuration
reporters: [
  'default',
  ['jest-html-reporters', { /* HTML report config */ }],
  ['jest-junit', { /* JUnit XML config */ }],
  ['<rootDir>/__tests__/utils/qa-reporter.js'], // Custom QA reporter
],

// Coverage configuration
collectCoverage: true,
collectCoverageFrom: [
  'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  '!src/**/*.d.ts',
  '!src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}',
],
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 70,
    functions: 70,
    lines: 70,
    statements: 70,
  },
},
```

### Coverage Thresholds

The system enforces minimum coverage requirements:
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Lines**: 70%
- **Statements**: 70%

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:report
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: test-reports
          path: test-reports/
```

### Jenkins Integration

The JUnit XML report can be used with Jenkins:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run test:report'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            junit 'test-reports/junit/junit.xml'
            publishHTML([
                allowMissing: false,
                alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                keepAll: true,
                reportDir: 'test-reports/html',
                reportFiles: 'test-report.html',
                reportName: 'Test Report'
            ])
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Report Review
- Review test reports after each test run
- Monitor success rate trends
- Address failing tests promptly

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Identify and optimize slow tests
- Consider parallel test execution for large test suites
- Monitor test execution time trends

### 3. Coverage Maintenance
- Maintain coverage above thresholds
- Add tests for uncovered code paths
- Review coverage reports for gaps

### 4. Report Archiving
- Archive reports for historical analysis
- Use reports for release quality gates
- Share reports with stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reports not generated**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Jest configuration
   - Verify test execution completed successfully

2. **Coverage thresholds not met**
   - Add tests for uncovered code
   - Review coverage exclusions
   - Consider adjusting thresholds if appropriate

3. **Slow test execution**
   - Identify slow tests using performance metrics
   - Optimize test setup/teardown
   - Consider test parallelization

### Report Cleanup

```bash
# Remove all test reports
npm run report:clean

# Remove specific report types
rm -rf test-reports/html
rm -rf test-reports/junit
rm -rf test-reports/coverage
```
