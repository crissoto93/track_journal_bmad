# Story 1.4: Social Logins (Google & Apple)

## Status
TODO

## Story
**As a** new or returning user,
**I want** to sign up or log in using my Google or Apple account,
**so that** I can access the app without creating a new password.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Social login buttons are added to auth screens
2. Tapping the buttons initiates the Firebase social auth flows
3. A user document is created in Firestore on first-time social sign-in
4. The user is navigated to the dashboard on success
