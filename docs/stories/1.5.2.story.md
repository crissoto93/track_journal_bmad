## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- React Native Paper v5.14.x already installed for UI components [From: `docs/stories/1.1.story.md`]
- Basic navigation structure already set up with React Navigation [From: `docs/stories/1.1.story.md`]
- Placeholder screens already created [From: `docs/stories/1.1.story.md`]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript (~5.9), React Native (~0.81), React Navigation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must work on both iOS and Android platforms
- Icons must be accessible and meet platform guidelines

### File Locations
- Navigation configuration in `src/navigation/` directory
- Screen components in `src/screens/` directory
- Icon utilities in `src/components/` or `src/utils/` directory
- Vector icons configuration in platform-specific files

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing React Navigation setup
- Work with React Native Paper theme system
- Ensure compatibility with existing screen components
- Follow established design system patterns

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- iOS: Icons need to be added to Info.plist and font files linked
- Android: Icons need to be added to build.gradle configuration
- Both platforms need proper font linking for vector icons
