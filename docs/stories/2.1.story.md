  - [x] Ensure consistent navigation patterns
- [x] Task 6: Testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Write unit tests for vehicle service functions
  - [x] Test vehicle form validation and submission
  - [x] Test garage screen with various vehicle states
  - [x] Test offline functionality for vehicle operations
  - [x] Integration tests with Firestore emulator

## Dev Notes
- Vehicle data should be associated with the authenticated user
- Consider implementing vehicle image upload functionality (future enhancement)
- Vehicle make/model data should come from a standardized database (FR8)
- Implement proper data validation for vehicle specifications
- Consider vehicle sharing capabilities for team scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test vehicle service methods with Firestore emulator
- Test form validation and submission flows
- Test garage screen with empty, loading, and populated states
- Test offline functionality and data synchronization
- Manual testing on iOS and Android devices
- Test vehicle list performance with large datasets

   - Inline styles in SearchableDropdown component (2 instances)
   - Nested component definitions in VehicleCard and GarageScreen (3 instances)
   - Unused variable in VehicleCard component
   - Missing useEffect dependency in GarageScreen
   - Variable shadowing in vehicles service (2 instances)

2. **Code Quality Issues:**
   - Some components defined during render (performance concern)
   - Minor TypeScript configuration warning (version 5.9.2 not officially supported)

### Performance & Security Review
- **Performance:** ‚úÖ Efficient data fetching and state management

   - Add radix parameter to parseInt calls
   - Move nested component definitions outside render functions

2. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Consider implementing vehicle image upload (noted in dev notes)
   - Add vehicle sharing capabilities for team scenarios
   - Implement vehicle editing functionality (currently marked as TODO)

### Final Assessment
**Overall Quality:** **B+ (85/100)**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates solid engineering practices. The code is well-structured, properly tested, and follows React Native best practices. Minor code quality issues are present but don't impact functionality. The vehicle management system is production-ready with proper error handling, validation, and user experience considerations.
