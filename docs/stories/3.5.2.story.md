# Story 3.5.2: Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Status
ðŸ”„ **PENDING** - Ready for development

## Story
**As a** driver,
**I want** to see aggregated analytics about my track performance,
**so that** I can track my improvement over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard shows key performance indicators and trends
2. Users can view progress over time with historical data
3. Analytics are calculated efficiently and update in real-time
4. Users can export or share their analytics data
5. Analytics respect user privacy and data preferences

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Session history and filtering already implemented in Stories 3.1-3.3
- Data visualization components from Story 3.5.1 can be reused
- Session data models already established in architecture

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript (~5.9), React Native (~0.81), React Native Paper (~5.14.x) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must work offline for viewing saved analytics
- Analytics calculations must be efficient for mobile devices

### File Locations
- Analytics dashboard components in `src/screens/AnalyticsScreen.tsx`
- Analytics calculation utilities in `src/services/analytics.ts`
- Data processing and aggregation in `src/utils/` directory
- Export functionality in `src/services/export.ts`

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing session data from Firestore
- Work with established design system from Story 1.5.1
- Use visualization components from Story 3.5.1
- Ensure compatibility with offline data access

### Data Models
- Analytics should aggregate data from existing session documents
- Create analytics document structure for cached calculations
- Implement efficient data models for time-series analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Analytics calculations should be optimized for mobile performance
- Implement background processing for complex calculations
- Cache frequently accessed analytics data
- Use efficient algorithms for large dataset processing

### Privacy and Security
- Analytics should respect user privacy preferences
- Implement data anonymization for shared analytics
- Ensure secure data export and sharing
- Follow data protection best practices
