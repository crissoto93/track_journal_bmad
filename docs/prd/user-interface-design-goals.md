# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be optimized for speed and clarity, designed for use in a potentially hectic racetrack environment. The guiding principle is "Get in, log data, get out." The interface should be intuitive, with minimal distractions, allowing a driver to capture their thoughts and data quickly and accurately.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Rapid Data Entry:** Forms will feature large touch targets and smart defaults. The flow of the session log will follow a driver's natural post-session mental checklist.
* **Bottom Tab Navigation:** A simple bottom navigation bar will provide access to the main sections of the app (e.g., New Session, Garage, History).
* **Visual-First Logging:** Where possible, data entry will be supported by visual aids, such as a simple graphic of the car for inputting tire pressures and temperatures at each corner.

## Core Screens and Views

* Authentication Screens (Sign-up, Log-in)
* Dashboard / New Session Screen
* "My Garage" Screen
* Vehicle Detail/Edit Screen
* Session Logging Form
* Session History Screen
* Session Detail View Screen

## Accessibility

* The application will target **WCAG AA** compliance to ensure it is usable by people with common disabilities.

## Branding

* The visual style will adhere to the "dark color scheme with silver/white accents" requirement.

## Target Device and Platforms

* The application will be designed as a mobile-first experience for **iOS and Android** devices.
