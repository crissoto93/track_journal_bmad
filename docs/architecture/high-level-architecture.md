# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

This document outlines a fullstack architecture for the "Track Journal" mobile application. The system is designed as a mobile-first, offline-capable application built with React Native. It will utilize a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) model, leveraging Google Firebase for authentication, database, and future serverless capabilities. The architecture is driver-centric, ensuring all data is owned by the user, while being structured to support future collaborative features. The primary focus is on performance, reliability in offline environments, and creating a scalable foundation for the product's long-term vision, including the AI voice assistant.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

* **Platform:** Google Firebase
* **Key Services:**
   * **Firebase Authentication:** For handling email/password, Google, and Apple sign-in.
   * **Firestore:** A NoSQL, cloud-hosted database for all user data, providing robust offline data persistence.
   * **Firebase Functions (for future use):** A serverless platform to be used for post-MVP features like the AI voice assistant.
* **Deployment Host and Regions:** Cloud infrastructure will be hosted on Google Cloud Platform, primarily in US-based regions, configurable as needed.

## Repository Structure

* **Structure:** Monorepo.
* **Monorepo Tool:** A single repository managed with standard npm/yarn workspaces.
* **Package Organization:** The initial structure will contain the main React Native application. A `packages/functions` directory can be added later to house serverless logic for post-MVP features, keeping all project code in one place.

## Architectural and Design Patterns

  * **Client-BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service):** The mobile app will communicate directly with Firebase services.
      * *Rationale:* This dramatically accelerates MVP development by leveraging managed services for authentication, the database, and offline sync, minimizing the need for custom backend code.
  * **Offline-First:** The application will be architected to be fully functional without an internet connection.
      * *Rationale:* This is a core requirement to ensure the app is reliable at racetracks, which is the primary user environment.
  * **Component-Based UI:** The React Native application will be built using small, reusable components.
      * *Rationale:* This promotes a clean, maintainable, and testable user interface codebase.
  * **Repository Pattern:** All direct communication with Firestore will be abstracted into a dedicated data access layer (the "repository").
      * *Rationale:* This mitigates the risk of vendor lock-in. If we ever need to migrate to a different backend, only this isolated layer of code would need to be rewritten.
