# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Firebase Setup

## Status
InProgress

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new React Native project initialized with all core dependencies and connected to a Firebase project,
**so that** I have a stable foundation to start building features.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Firebase SDK is installed and configured for iOS/Android
3. The app connects to the Firebase project on startup
4. A basic placeholder screen is visible
