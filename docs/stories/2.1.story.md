# Story 2.1: View "My Garage" and Add Vehicle

## Status
âœ… **READY FOR REVIEW** - Vehicle management implementation completed

## Story
**As a** driver,
**I want** to see a list of my cars and be able to add a new car to my garage,
**so that** I can organize my vehicles for session logging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 1. A "My Garage" screen is created
- [ ] 2. The screen lists the user's vehicles
- [ ] 3. An "Add Vehicle" button opens a form
- [ ] 4. Make/Model fields use the searchable drop-down component (FR8)
- [ ] 5. Submitting creates a new vehicle in Firestore
- [ ] 6. The new vehicle appears in the list

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Add "Add Vehicle" button with proper styling
  - [x] Handle empty state when no vehicles exist
  - [x] Add loading states for vehicle data fetching
- [x] Task 2: Implement Vehicle Data Service (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create vehicle service functions for CRUD operations
  - [x] Implement getVehicles() to fetch user's vehicles from Firestore
  - [x] Implement addVehicle() to create new vehicle documents
  - [x] Add proper error handling and validation

- [x] Task 3: Create Add Vehicle Form (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Design and implement vehicle form component
  - [x] Integrate searchable drop-down for Make/Model selection (FR8)
  - [x] Add form validation for required fields
  - [x] Implement form submission handling
  - [x] Add proper loading states during submission
- [x] Task 4: Vehicle Data Model & Firestore Integration (AC: 5, 6)

  - [x] Implement navigation between garage and add vehicle form
  - [x] Add proper back navigation and form cancellation
  - [x] Ensure consistent navigation patterns
- [x] Task 6: Testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Write unit tests for vehicle service functions
  - [x] Test vehicle form validation and submission
  - [x] Test garage screen with various vehicle states
  - [x] Test offline functionality for vehicle operations
  - [x] Integration tests with Firestore emulator

## Dev Notes
- Vehicle data should be associated with the authenticated user
- Consider implementing vehicle image upload functionality (future enhancement)
- Vehicle make/model data should come from a standardized database (FR8)
- Implement proper data validation for vehicle specifications
- Consider vehicle sharing capabilities for team scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test vehicle service methods with Firestore emulator
- Test form validation and submission flows
- Test garage screen with empty, loading, and populated states
- Test offline functionality and data synchronization
- Manual testing on iOS and Android devices
- Test vehicle list performance with large datasets
