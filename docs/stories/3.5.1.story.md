# Story 3.5.1: Session Data Visualization

## Status
ðŸ”„ **PENDING** - Ready for development

## Story
**As a** driver,
**I want** to see visual representations of my session data,
**so that** I can quickly identify patterns and trends in my performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Charts and graphs display key performance metrics
2. Data is presented in an easy-to-understand format
3. Users can compare multiple sessions visually
4. Charts are responsive and work on different screen sizes
5. Data visualization follows accessibility guidelines

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Select and Implement Charting Library (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Research and select appropriate React Native charting library
  - [ ] Install and configure charting library (e.g., react-native-chart-kit, victory-native)
  - [ ] Create chart wrapper components for consistent styling
  - [ ] Implement basic chart types (line, bar, scatter, radar)
  - [ ] Ensure charts work with established design system

- [ ] Task 2: Design Key Performance Visualizations (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create lap time trend charts showing improvement over sessions
  - [ ] Implement speed analysis charts (top speed, average speed)
  - [ ] Design temperature and pressure monitoring graphs
  - [ ] Create tire wear and performance correlation charts
  - [ ] Add weather condition impact visualizations

- [ ] Task 3: Implement Session Comparison Features (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create multi-session overlay charts
  - [ ] Implement session selection interface for comparison
  - [ ] Add side-by-side session comparison views
  - [ ] Create session difference highlighting
  - [ ] Implement session filtering for comparison

- [ ] Task 4: Ensure Responsive Design (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test charts on different screen sizes and orientations
  - [ ] Implement responsive chart sizing and layout
  - [ ] Optimize chart performance for mobile devices
  - [ ] Add touch interactions for chart exploration
  - [ ] Ensure charts work in both portrait and landscape modes

- [ ] Task 5: Implement Accessibility Features (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add screen reader support for chart data
  - [ ] Implement high contrast mode for charts
  - [ ] Add keyboard navigation for chart interactions
  - [ ] Create alternative text descriptions for charts
  - [ ] Ensure color-blind friendly chart palettes

- [ ] Task 6: Data Processing and Performance
  - [ ] Implement efficient data processing for chart generation
  - [ ] Add data aggregation functions for performance metrics
  - [ ] Create caching mechanisms for chart data
  - [ ] Optimize chart rendering performance
  - [ ] Add data export functionality for charts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Session history functionality already implemented in Story 3.1 [From: `docs/stories/3.1.story.md`]
- Session filtering already implemented in Story 3.2 [From: `docs/stories/3.2.story.md`]
- Session detail viewing already implemented in Story 3.3 [From: `docs/stories/3.3.story.md`]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript (~5.9), React Native (~0.81), React Native Paper (~5.14.x) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must work offline for viewing saved session data
- Chart library must be compatible with React Native

### File Locations
- Chart components in `src/components/charts/` directory
- Data processing utilities in `src/utils/` or `src/services/`
- Visualization screens in `src/screens/` directory
- Design system tokens from `src/theme/` directory

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing session data from Firestore
- Work with established design system from Story 1.5.1
- Use existing session filtering and selection functionality
- Ensure compatibility with offline data access

### Data Models
- Session document structure already defined in architecture
- Charts should visualize data from session fields (lap times, speeds, temperatures, etc.)
- Data aggregation should respect user privacy and data preferences

### Performance Considerations
- Charts should load quickly even with large datasets
- Implement progressive loading for complex visualizations
- Cache processed chart data to improve performance
- Consider data sampling for very large datasets
